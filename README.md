From the dev team that brought you *Duck Duck Shoe*.

Mutant Games is an open source video game lobby service! Users can create and join lobbies to connect with their friends and chat about their favorite video games.

## Getting Started:

Here are links to the [deployed applcation](https://mutant-games.herokuapp.com/) and a [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/K7ydDNPv/tmnt) containing planning materials.

To run the project locally:

1. Navigate to the directory you want to clone this app into and run the command 

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Team-Mutant/Mutant-games-back-end.git
```

2. After cloning the directory, run the command 

```bash
touch .env
```

3. Add the following lines of code to the .env file you just created, filling in the `<bracketed-placeholders>` with your own info.

```bash
DATABASE_URL=mongodb+srv://<your-username>:<your-password>@cluster0.53jre.mongodb.net/<datbase-name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority

SECRET=<create-a-secret-key>
```

4. Install all dependencies by running the command 

```bash
npm i
```

5. Spin up the app by running the command 

```bash
npm start
```

6. Clone and initiate the [front-end repository](https://github.com/Team-Mutant/Mutant-games-front-end) (following the step-by-step setup guide in the README)
